\noindent \textbf{Homework 2:}\vspace{1em}\\
\emph{Complete the following opportunities to use what we've talked about in class. These questions will be graded for correctness, communication and succinctness. Ensure you show your work and explain your logic in a legible and refined submission.}\\\vspace{1em}
%Comments -- anything after % is not put into the PDF

The starting jobs will be applied in alphabetical order (last name) for question two.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Solver:} provide a solution, if possible, and reasoning for the solution. \textbf{Due to group 10/5 or earlier.}
  \item \textbf{Code Checker:} provides a first check of the solver's worked solutions and ensures they are correct with a solid interpretation. 
  \item \textbf{Checker} checks the solution for completeness, proposes and implements changes if agreed upon by the group. Provides a short paragraph summarizing the discussion of proposals and their reason for acceptance or non-acceptance.
  \item \textbf{Double Checker} checks the solution for completeness, communication and polish. The Double Checker ensures that the solution is correct and highly polished for submission.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent For subsequent questions student roles will move down one position. The rolls change as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Solver} $\Longrightarrow$ \textbf{Code Checker}
  \item \textbf{Code Checker} $\Longrightarrow$ \textbf{Checker}
  \item \textbf{Checker} $\Longrightarrow$ \textbf{Double Checker}
  \item \textbf{Double Checker} $\Longrightarrow$ \textbf{Solver}

While students have assigned jobs for each question I encourage students to help 
each other complete the homework in collaboration.

  \item\label{Q1} Select a continuous distribution (Not the uniform or exponential). 
  It does not have to be one that we cover in the notes! To explore the PDF of your 
  distribution, specify two sets of parameter(s) for your distribution.\\
\textbf{Solution:} The Gaussian Distribution: Parameter sets: (mean=0, SD=1) and (mean=1, SD=2)\\

  \item \textbf{History} Discuss what types of random variables are modeled with 
  your distribution. Be sure to include a discussion about the support and ensure 
  to provide the density function, and CDF. This requires some internet research 
  -- what's the history of the distribution, why was it created and named? What 
  are some exciting applications of this distribution?

\textbf{Solution:} We chose to look at the Gaussian distribution for our continuous distribution. The Gaussian distribution is also known as the normal distribution and is very common in terms of independent, randomly generated variables. It is well known for the bell-shaped curve and is a very important probability graph in statistics. Its characterized by two parameters, the mean and standard deviation. Abraham DeMoivre derived formulas related to the curve early on in the 1600s; however, the name "Gaussian distribution" comes from Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician. He independently created a two-parameter exponential function in 1809 related to astronomical observation errors. James Clerk Maxwell, a British physicist, also had an early application of the normal distribution in 1859 with his law of distribution of molecular velocities. The "normal curve" formally appeared in 1870.

\textbf{Solution:} Changing the mean of these curves affects where the peak (max) is along the x-axis. The standard deviation determines the actual height (max). The curves with standard deviations of 2 are smaller than those with standard deviation 1.

\textbf{Solution:} Increasing the mean shifts the curves on the x-axis and where they end up when f(x) is 0.5. The standard deviation effects their path in terms of steepness. The curves with standard deviation 1 are steeper than the curves with standard deviation. Further, the validity of this CDF is shown as all values are positive and less than or equal to 1.
