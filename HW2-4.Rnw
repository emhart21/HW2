%%%%%%%%%  Question 4 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Continue with the discrete distribution you selected for Question 3.
\begin{enumerate}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%  Part (a)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item Provide the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the PMF. 
  Ensure to interpret each.\\
  \textbf{Solution:}
  <<>>=

bern.summ <- function(p){
  bern.mean <- p                     #mean = expected value = p
  bern.sd   <- sqrt(p*(1-p))         #sqrt of variance
  bern.skew <- (1-2*p)/bern.sd        
  bern.kurt <- (1-6*p*(1-p))/(p*(1-p))
  datf <- data.frame(mean=bern.mean, sd=bern.sd, skew=bern.skew, kurt=bern.kurt)
  return(datf)
}

bern.summ(0.5)
bern.summ(0.75)
@
For the parameter 0.5, both the mean and standard deviation are 0.5.  This makes 
sense, as with this probability, there are an equal number of observations of 0 
and 1, making the mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.5 (as both 0 and 1 are 0.5 away 
from the mean 0.5).  Because it is a symmetric distribution, the skewness is zero.
The kurtosis is -2, representing this flat, platykurtic distribution.

For the parameter 0.75, both the mean is 0.75 and with standard deviation 0.433.
Because it is not symmetric distribution, with higher values occuring more frequently,
the skewness is -1.15. The kurtosis is -0.67, again representing a platykurtic distribution.

  \item Generate a random sample of size $n=10, 25, 100$, and $1000$ for your 
  two sets of parameter(s). Calculate the sample mean, standard deviation, 
  skewness, and kurtosis. Interpret the results.\\

## n=10, p=0.5
bern.rand.summ(10,.5)

## n=25, p=0.5
bern.rand.summ(25,.5)

## n=100, p=0.5
bern.rand.summ(100,.5)

## n=1000, p=0.5
bern.rand.summ(1000,.5)

## n=10, p=0.75
bern.rand.summ(10, .75)

## n=25, p=0.75
bern.rand.summ(25, .75)

## n=100, p=0.75
bern.rand.summ(100, .75)

## n=1000, p=0.75
bern.rand.summ(1000, .75)
@
The values seen here are close to the ones predicted above.  We can see that in the cases that p=0.5,
the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis remain relatively close to the predicted
0.5, 0.5, 0, and -2, respectively.  Similarly, in the cases that p=0.75, the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and 
kurtosis remain relatively close to the predicted 0.75, 0.433, -1.15, and -0.67.
Further, it seems that generally, as n increases, the summary statistics derived from observation approach
those predicted.  The package e1071, from \cite{e1071}, is used for the calculation of skewness and kurtosis.

  %%%%%%%%%  Part (c)
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item Generate a random sample of size $n=10$ for your two sets of parameter(s).
  Calculate the method of moments estimator(s) and maximum likelihood estimator(s).
  In a $1 \times 2$ grid, plot a histogram (with bin size 1) of each set of data 
  with (1) the method of moments estimated distribution, (2) the maximum likelihood 
  estimated distribution, and superimpose the true distribution in both.\\
  \textbf{Solution:}
  Note that for the Bernoulli Distribution, the methods of moments estimation is quite simplified.  Because only the values of 0 and 1 are included in the support, and because each power of both 1 and 0 are equal to 1 and 0 ($1^k=1$ and $0^k=0$ for all k), each moment is equal to the original mean of the data.  Therefore, the function we would minimize for our estimation would be the parameter p minus the mean of the data, which we can solve easily by setting p equal to the mean of the data.  In each case, the method of moments estimator will be able to perfectly represent the randomly generated set of data.
  The below code is used to set up functions for the Bernoulli Distribution.
